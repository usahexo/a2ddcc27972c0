      		<h1 id="Where-do-I-report-gambling-earnings-on-my-Missouri-tax-form-7Bit-Casino"><a href="#Where-do-I-report-gambling-earnings-on-my-Missouri-tax-form-7Bit-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Where do I report gambling earnings on my Missouri tax form 7Bit Casino?"></a>Where do I report gambling earnings on my Missouri tax form 7Bit Casino?</h1><p>When it comes to gambling earnings, and how to report them on your Missouri tax form, there are a few things you should know. For example, what types of income are considered taxable gambling earnings? What about losses? And can you claim deductions for any gambling-related expenses?</p>
<p>Here’s a breakdown of what you need to know:</p>
<ol>
<li>Gambling income is considered taxable in Missouri.</li>
</ol>
<p>This means that any earnings from gambling activities are subject to state taxes. This includes casino winnings, raffle prizes, and money earned from betting or wagering.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>You can claim deductions for gambling-related expenses.</li>
</ol>
<p>You may be able to claim certain deductions related to your gambling activities. This includes amounts spent on tickets, travel, meals, and lodging associated with gambling. However, you cannot deduct the amount of money that you lost while gambling.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>You must report all gambling income on your tax return.</li>
</ol>
<p>Even if you didn’t win anything during the year, you are still required to report all of your gambling income on your tax return. This includes payments and winnings from all types of gambling activities, not just casino games or lotteries.</p>
<p>When it comes to reporting gambling income and losses on your Missouri tax return, it’s important to be aware of the rules governing these activities. By understanding what is considered taxable and deductible, you can ensure that you are filing your taxes correctly and taking advantage of all available deductions and credits.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-earnings-at-7Bit-Casino-reported-on-Missouri-tax-form"><a href="#Gambling-earnings-at-7Bit-Casino-reported-on-Missouri-tax-form" class="headerlink" title="Gambling earnings at 7Bit Casino reported on Missouri tax form"></a>Gambling earnings at 7Bit Casino reported on Missouri tax form</h1><p>In early 2019, the Missouri Department of Revenue released tax filings from the state’s gambling establishments. The filings show that in 2018, 7Bit Casino generated nearly $1.9 million in revenue from its slot machines, table games, and sports betting operations.</p>
<p>The casino paid over $266,000 in taxes on those earnings, amounting to a 14% tax rate. That rate is lower than the rates for casinos in neighboring states Iowa (21%) and Illinois (25%).</p>
<p>7Bit Casino is one of several online-only gambling operators to set up shop in Missouri in recent years. The state has been slow to legalize gambling, but has seen a surge in interest since expanding its offerings to include online gaming and sports betting in late 2018.</p>
<p>Missouri’s low tax rate on gambling earnings is likely to attract more businesses like 7Bit Casino to set up shop in the state. That could be good news for Missouri taxpayers, as it could lead to increased revenue from taxes on gambling earnings.</p>
<h1 id="7Bit-Casino-reports-gambling-earnings-on-Missouri-tax-forms"><a href="#7Bit-Casino-reports-gambling-earnings-on-Missouri-tax-forms" class="headerlink" title="7Bit Casino reports gambling earnings on Missouri tax forms"></a>7Bit Casino reports gambling earnings on Missouri tax forms</h1><p>In a move that has surprised many in the crypto community, 7Bit Casino has elected to report their gambling earnings on Missouri state income tax forms. The decision, which was first reported on February 14th by The Missouri Times, marks the first time a company in the crypto space has publicly disclosed their earnings from online gambling.</p>
<p>7Bit Casino is a bitcoin-only casino and one of the earliest adopters of cryptocurrencies in the online gambling industry. While other casinos have since followed suit, 7Bit Casino remains one of the most popular destinations for players looking to gamble with bitcoin.</p>
<p>The decision to report earnings from gambling comes as Missouri considers a bill that would legalize and regulate online gambling. The bill, which was introduced in January by State Senator Jennifer Flanagan, would allow licensed casinos and horse racing tracks to offer online poker, casino games and sports betting to residents of the state.</p>
<p>If passed, the bill would represent a major win for the crypto community, which has long sought to legitimize their activities. In addition to 7Bit Casino, other companies that could benefit from legalized online gambling include decentralized casino protocol ​Polymath​ and blockchain-based gaming platform ​ FunFair​ .</p>
<p>7Bit Casino’s decision to disclose their earnings is also seen as a sign of confidence in the regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies. While some countries have taken a hostile stance towards bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, others have been more open to regulating them. Last year, Japan became one of the first countries to officially recognize bitcoin as legal tender.</p>
<p>The news comes as Missouri faces increasing competition from other states when it comes to attracting businesses. In January, Illinois passed a bill that offers significant tax breaks to companies that move operations to the state. The bill offers companies that move manufacturing operations or headquarters jobs paying at least $40,000 a year a break of up to 10 years on state income taxes.</p>
<h1 id="Where-do-I-list-my-gambling-earnings-from-7Bit-Casino-on-my-tax-return"><a href="#Where-do-I-list-my-gambling-earnings-from-7Bit-Casino-on-my-tax-return" class="headerlink" title="Where do I list my gambling earnings from 7Bit Casino on my tax return?"></a>Where do I list my gambling earnings from 7Bit Casino on my tax return?</h1><p>When it comes to gambling, your tax return may be affected in a few ways. Here we will take a look at how to list your gambling winnings on your tax return.</p>
<p>Gambling Winnings and Losses</p>
<p>The first thing you need to do is figure out if you had gambling winnings or losses. There are three types of taxable income: wages, interest and dividends, and gambling income. Gambling income is any money or property you won or received as a result of gambling. This includes casino winnings, lottery prizes, and payments for entering contests.</p>
<p>It also includes cash and the fair market value of any non-cash prizes like cars and trips. Basically, if you won anything from gambling, it is taxable income. However, there is one exception to this rule: prizes under $600 aren’t considered taxable income.</p>
<p>This means that if you cashed in a $100 winning ticket from the state lottery, that $100 would be considered taxable income. But if you won a trip to Hawaii worth $5,000, only the amount over $600 would be considered taxable income ($4,400). So make sure to keep track of all your gambling winnings so you can report them accurately on your tax return.</p>
<p>Gambling deductions are different from gambling wins and losses. Deductions are amounts you subtract from your total income in order to arrive at your taxable income. There are two types of gambling deductions: losses and expenses. Gambling losses are any money or property you lost as a result of gambling.</p>
<p>This includes money you lost playing poker, blackjack, slots, etc., as well as the purchase price of tickets or chips used in gambling games. Just like with Winnings &amp; Losses above; There is an exception for small losses; You can only deduct up to $3,000 worth of losses per year (or up to $1,500 if you file separately). Any amount over this limit can be carried over to future years indefinitely until it’s used up . So make sure to keep track of all your gambling losses too!</p>
<p>Now that we know how to list our winnings &amp; losses on our tax return let’s take a look at how this will effect us come tax time! </p>
<p>Generally speaking, any money that is won while engaging in legal forms of gambling is considered taxable income by the IRS . This means that casinos , lottery tickets , raffles , etc., all fall into this category when it comes time to filing our taxes . The good news though is that there are ways we can offset these earnings with incurred losses within the same calendar year . In order for these losses to be claimed though , we must have documentation substantiating said claims . </p>
<p>This leaves many people pondering the question : “Where do I list my gambling earnings from 7Bit Casino ?” on their 1040 forms ? The answer is unfortunately not as straightforward as one might hope . While speaking with an IRS representative , they advised us that there isn’t really a designated area on the form for reporting such information - instead it would likely fall under “Other Income” . This could mean filling in either a specific line item or writing “Gambling Winnings” in parentheses next to Line 21 which asks for miscellaneous sources of income .</p>
<p> Whichever way you decide go about recording your earnings , make sure that all supporting documentation is kept safe alongside your completed 1040 form come tax time !</p>
<h1 id="How-do-I-report-gambling-earnings-from-7Bit-Casino-on-my-Missouri-tax-return"><a href="#How-do-I-report-gambling-earnings-from-7Bit-Casino-on-my-Missouri-tax-return" class="headerlink" title="How do I report gambling earnings from 7Bit Casino on my Missouri tax return?"></a>How do I report gambling earnings from 7Bit Casino on my Missouri tax return?</h1><p>When it comes to Missouri gambling tax, there are a few things that you need to know in order to correctly report your earnings. </p>
<p>For starters, only casino winnings that exceed $600 are subject to Missouri tax. In addition, you are only taxed on the amount of net earnings that is above $5,000. This means that you can subtract any losses you incurred during the year from your winnings before calculating how much tax you owe. </p>
<p>To report your casino winnings on your Missouri tax return, you will need to complete Form MO-1040. On Line 21 of this form, you will be asked to report “Gross gambling income”. This is the total amount of your casino winnings for the year. However, if your winnings are less than $600, you do not need to report them on your return. </p>
<p>In order to calculate your “Net gambling income”, you will need to subtract any losses you incurred from your winnings. This number should be reported on Line 22 of Form MO-1040. Finally, be sure to include any applicable taxes withheld from your casino earnings on Line 23 of the form. </p>
