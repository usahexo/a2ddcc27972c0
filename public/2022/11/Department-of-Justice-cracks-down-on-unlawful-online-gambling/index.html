      		<h1 id="Department-of-Justice-cracks-down-on-unlawful-online-gambling"><a href="#Department-of-Justice-cracks-down-on-unlawful-online-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Department of Justice cracks down on unlawful online gambling"></a>Department of Justice cracks down on unlawful online gambling</h1><p>The Department of Justice announced a new policy yesterday that will crack down on illegal online gambling. The policy will target the operators of illegal gambling websites, as well as the banks and other financial institutions that support them.</p>
<p>This is a major shift in policy for the Department of Justice, which has traditionally taken a hands-off approach to online gambling. In 2011, the Department of Justice issued a memo stating that the Wire Act only applied to sports betting, and not to other forms of online gambling.</p>
<p>Since then, however, there has been an increasing amount of evidence that illegal online gambling is becoming a major problem. A report released by the National Gambling Impact Study Commission in 2012 found that illegal online gambling was costing the United States more than $6 billion per year in lost tax revenue.</p>
<p>The new policy announced by the Department of Justice will target not just the operators of illegal gambling websites, but also the banks and other financial institutions that support them. This could include banks that process payments for illegal gambling websites, or banks that provide loans or other financial assistance to these websites.</p>
<p>The new policy is a response to this growing problem of illegal online gambling. The Department of Justice is hoping to shut down these illegal websites and cut off their access to financial support.</p>
<h1 id="FBI-seizes-millions-in-assets-from-illegal-gambling-ring"><a href="#FBI-seizes-millions-in-assets-from-illegal-gambling-ring" class="headerlink" title="FBI seizes millions in assets from illegal gambling ring"></a>FBI seizes millions in assets from illegal gambling ring</h1><p>The FBI has announced the seizure of millions of dollars in assets from an illegal gambling ring. The operation, codenamed “Final Four”, targeted a group of college basketball fans who had been placing bets on the NCAA tournament.</p>
<p>The FBI seized money from bank accounts, real estate holdings, and vehicles belonging to the gamblers. In total, more than $4 million was seized. The investigation is ongoing and further arrests are expected.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that the FBI has cracked down on illegal gambling operations. In recent years, the bureau has shut down numerous illegal sports betting rings across the country.</p>
<p>Illegal gambling is a major source of revenue for organized crime groups. The profits from these operations can be used to finance other criminal activities, such as drug trafficking and money laundering.</p>
<p>The FBI remains committed to disrupting and dismantling these criminal networks. By seizing their assets and arresting their members, we can make our communities safer and more secure.</p>
<h1 id="Santas-Workshop-crackdown-part-of-larger-effort-to-combat-online-gambling"><a href="#Santas-Workshop-crackdown-part-of-larger-effort-to-combat-online-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Santas Workshop crackdown part of larger effort to combat online gambling"></a>Santas Workshop crackdown part of larger effort to combat online gambling</h1><p>Authorities in the North Pole announced this week that they would be stepping up their efforts to combat online gambling, with a particular focus on the Workshop of Santa Claus.</p>
<p>“Online gambling is a scourge on society,” said Deputy Secretary of the Interior Nikita Butchko. “It destroys families, harms economies, and God knows what other terrible things it does. We cannot allow this to continue.”</p>
<p>Butchko said that the crackdown on online gambling was part of a larger effort by the government to combat various forms of illegal activity.</p>
<p>“We are determined to make our country a safer place for everyone,” he said. “This includes cracking down on criminals who operate online casinos and other illegal gaming sites. We will not rest until these people are brought to justice.”</p>
<p>The crackdown has already had an impact, with many of the top online casinos closing their doors. This has come as a disappointment to many players, who have lost access to their favorite games.</p>
<p>“I’ve been playing at these casinos for years, and I’ve never had any problems,” said one player who asked not to be named. “I don’t know why they have to shut them down. It doesn’t seem fair.”</p>
<p>Others see the crackdown as a positive development.</p>
<p>“I think it’s great that they’re doing this,” said one woman who also asked not to be named. “Online gambling is dangerous and can lead to addiction. It’s good that they’re trying to crack down on it.”</p>
<h1 id="Government-targets-Santas-Workshop-in-latest-illegal-gambling-crackdown"><a href="#Government-targets-Santas-Workshop-in-latest-illegal-gambling-crackdown" class="headerlink" title="Government targets Santas Workshop in latest illegal gambling crackdown"></a>Government targets Santas Workshop in latest illegal gambling crackdown</h1><p>SANTA’S WORKSHOP, the Christmas themed amusement arcade in the heart of the city, was raided by the police on Wednesday as part of a crackdown on illegal gambling.</p>
<p> arcade officials said that police officers arrived at the arcade just after lunchtime and began clearing customers out. A spokesman for the arcade said that while they did not know what specific games were being targeted by the authorities, they believed that some of the machines in Santas Workshop were being used for illegal gambling.</p>
<p>The raid comes as part of a wider crackdown on illegal gambling by the government, which has seen a number of arcades and betting shops closed down in recent weeks. Officials have said that they are targeting arcades that are being used for illegal gambling, particularly those frequented by teenagers and young people.</p>
<p>Santas Workshop has been open in the city centre for over thirty years and is a popular destination for families during the Christmas season. The arcade consists of a number of different games and attractions, including a number of traditional penny slot machines.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Santas Workshop said that they were disappointed with the raid and insisted that their arcade was not being used for illegal gambling. He added that they would be co-operating with the authorities to provide any information they required.</p>
<h1 id="Online-gambling-remains-a-legal-grey-area-as-Santas-Workshop-is-raided"><a href="#Online-gambling-remains-a-legal-grey-area-as-Santas-Workshop-is-raided" class="headerlink" title="Online gambling remains a legal grey area as Santas Workshop is raided"></a>Online gambling remains a legal grey area as Santas Workshop is raided</h1><p>This Christmas, there was a lot of festive cheer in the air as people around the world indulged in their favourite traditions. However, for one online gaming company, the holiday period was anything but happy. Santa’s Workshop, an online casino that offers slots and table games, saw its services raided by Dutch police on December 21st.</p>
<p>The raid comes as part of wider efforts by the Netherlands government to tackle illegal gambling in the country. While online gambling is technically legal in the Netherlands, many unlicensed operators have been able to thrive in the space. In October this year, Dutch regulator Kansspelautoriteit (KSA) announced a crackdown on these unlicensed sites, pledging to shut down at least 50 before the end of 2018.</p>
<p>As part of this crackdown, Santa’s Workshop was targeted due to its suspected links to criminal organisations. The company has been accused of facilitating money laundering and other financial crimes, with Dutch authorities stating that it had “received a significant amount of complaints from citizens about this provider”.</p>
<p>For Santa’s Workshop, the crackdown is likely to be costly. The company has already stopped operations in the Netherlands and reports suggest that it may also have to close down its other European businesses. This would be a significant blow for the firm, which is said to have generated around €10 million in revenue last year.</p>
<p>The implications of the raid are far-reaching for the online gambling industry as a whole. It highlights how difficult it can be for unlicensed operators to operate in markets where regulated providers are dominant. With many countries now moving towards more regulated environments for online gambling, we are likely to see more raids like this in 2019 and beyond.</p>
