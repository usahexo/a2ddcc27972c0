      		<h1 id="Denver-Nuggets-Lose-Tough-Twin-In-Blackjack"><a href="#Denver-Nuggets-Lose-Tough-Twin-In-Blackjack" class="headerlink" title="Denver Nuggets Lose Tough Twin In Blackjack"></a>Denver Nuggets Lose Tough Twin In Blackjack</h1><p>The Denver Nuggets went into the casino on the Las Vegas strip looking for a little action and they discovered twin brothers in blackjack. The twins were alike in every way, except one was a brilliant player and one was not.</p>
<p>The Nuggets decided to play as a team with the better player taking all the cards for the group. The bad player would then just watch and observe. Surely, this would give them an edge.</p>
<p>After a few hands, it became clear that the bad player’s poor skills were costing the team money. The good player was forced to take on more risk in order to make up for his brother’s mistakes.</p>
<p>Before long, the brilliant player had lost all of their money and the team was out $1,000. In the end, playing as a team cost them more money than if they had each played separately.</p>
<h1 id="Denver-Nuggets-Suffer-Hard-Twin-Loss"><a href="#Denver-Nuggets-Suffer-Hard-Twin-Loss" class="headerlink" title="Denver Nuggets Suffer Hard Twin Loss"></a>Denver Nuggets Suffer Hard Twin Loss</h1><p>The Denver Nuggets incurred a tough twin loss at the hands of LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers, 107-100, on Saturday night followed by a 127-115 home defeat to the Oklahoma City Thunder on Monday.</p>
<p>In the first game against the Cavaliers, Denver played well in the first half but couldn’t keep up with James’ onslaught in the second half, as he finished with 38 points. Nikola Jokic led all scorers for Denver with 21 points while also pulling down 11 rebounds. Gary Harris chipped in 20 points and Jamal Murray had 13.</p>
<p>In their matchup against Oklahoma City, it was a reversal of fortunes as the Nuggets controlled most of the game before wilting down the stretch. The Thunder’s Russell Westbrook had a triple double - 10 points, 14 assists and 17 rebounds - while Paul George led all scorers with 37 points. Jokic scored 23 points to go along with 12 rebounds and seven assists. Harris added 20 points.</p>
<p>Denver is now 5-5 on the young season as they head out on a five-game road trip that starts Wednesday night in Philadelphia against the 76ers.</p>
<h1 id="Nuggets-suffer-tough-loss-to-hard-twin"><a href="#Nuggets-suffer-tough-loss-to-hard-twin" class="headerlink" title="Nuggets suffer tough loss to hard twin"></a>Nuggets suffer tough loss to hard twin</h1><p>The Nuggets suffered a tough loss at the hands of the hard twin brothers last night. The twins were relentless, scoring at will and frustrating the Nuggets defense.</p>
<p>“They were just too good tonight,” said Nuggets coach Mike Malone. “We didn’t do enough to contain them.”</p>
<p>The twins were a difficult matchup for the Nuggets, as they are both extremely physical players who can score from anywhere on the court.</p>
<p>“We just had to match their intensity,” said Nuggets guard Gary Harris. “But they were just too much for us.”</p>
<p>The twins were led by Ben Simmons, who scored 30 points on 11-of-14 shooting. His brother, Joel, added 20 points and 10 rebounds.</p>
<p>The Nuggets fought hard but ultimately came up short against the hard twin brothers. They will look to bounce back when they take on the Lakers later this week.</p>
<h1 id="Denver-can’t-overcome-hard-twin-in-blackjack"><a href="#Denver-can’t-overcome-hard-twin-in-blackjack" class="headerlink" title="Denver can’t overcome hard twin in blackjack"></a>Denver can’t overcome hard twin in blackjack</h1><p>It was a hard night in the casino for Denver. He just couldn’t seem to win at blackjack. His twin sister was in town and she was cleaning up at the table. Denver started out strong, doubling his initial bet of $10 on the first hand. But he eventually lost all of that and then some.</p>
<p>He started to feel like he was doing something wrong, so he watched his sister play more closely. He noticed that she wasn’t betting as much on each hand, but she was still winning. It didn’t make sense to him how she could be losing money overall, but winning more hands.</p>
<p>Then it hit him - she was using basic strategy! She wasn’t betting as much because she knew that the odds were in her favor with each hand. Denver had been trying to guess what the dealer’s hidden card was, and that’s why he was losing.</p>
<p>He decided to try using basic strategy himself, and sure enough, he started winning hands too. He may have been down overall for the night, but at least he was making money on individual hands. Had he known about basic strategy from the start, he would have saved himself a lot of money.</p>
<h1 id="Nuggets-fall-to-hard-twin-in-blackjack-thriller"><a href="#Nuggets-fall-to-hard-twin-in-blackjack-thriller" class="headerlink" title="Nuggets fall to hard twin in blackjack thriller"></a>Nuggets fall to hard twin in blackjack thriller</h1><p>In a game that would have ramifications well into the postseason, the Denver Nuggets came up just short against the hard-charging twin brothers of basketball, losing to the blackjack variety in a thriller Friday night.</p>
<p>It was a tale of two halves for the home team. The Nuggets came out smoking in the first half, building up a sizeable lead and appearing poised to put away their opponents. But the blackjacks refused to go down easily, mounting an impressive comeback in the second half to take the lead. Denver had one final chance to win in regulation, but ultimately couldn’t pull it off.</p>
<p>There were heroes all around for both sides on this memorable night. Nikola Jokic led Denver with 29 points and 13 rebounds, while Jamal Murray added 24 points. For the blackjacks, it was a team effort with six players scoring in double figures.</p>
<p>The loss drops Denver to second place in the Western Conference, behind Golden State. They’ll need to bounce back quickly if they hope to hold onto that slot and make a deep playoff run.</p>
