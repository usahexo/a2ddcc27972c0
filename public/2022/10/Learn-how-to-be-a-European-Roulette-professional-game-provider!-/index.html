<p>There are two types of Roulette game providers: software providers and live dealers. To be a software provider, you must create and license a Roulette game software. To be a live dealer, you must provide a live streaming of a real roulette table.</p>
<p>To become a software provider, you must first create a roulette game. This can be done with any programming language, but it is advisable to use a library that is specifically designed for roulette games such as Ruby Roulette or PyRoulette. After your game is complete, you must then license it to an online casino. This process can be difficult, as casinos are often unwilling to take on new providers. However, if you can find the right casino and present them with a high-quality game, you may be able to get them interested.</p>
<p>To become a live dealer, you must first find a casino that is willing to work with you. Then, you must set up a live streaming of a real roulette table. This process can be difficult and expensive, as it requires both equipment and personnel. However, if done correctly, it can be very profitable.</p>
