                <h1>Socceroos Lose Out To Slovenia In Betting Odds</h1>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
      		<h1 id="Socceroos-Lose-Out-To-Slovenia-In-Betting-Odds"><a href="#Socceroos-Lose-Out-To-Slovenia-In-Betting-Odds" class="headerlink" title="Socceroos Lose Out To Slovenia In Betting Odds"></a>Socceroos Lose Out To Slovenia In Betting Odds</h1><p>The Australian socceroos have just taken a big hit with their betting odds, losing out to Slovenia in the process. The match up, which is set to take place on Saturday evening, has Slovenia as the favourites at 2&#x2F;5, while the Socceroos are coming in at 7&#x2F;2. This is a huge turnaround from when the two teams first faced off qualifying for the World Cup; at that time, Australia was listed as the favourite.</p>
<p>There are a few possible explanations for this shift in odds. One possibility is that Slovenia has been on a hot streak as of late, while Australia has been faltering. Additionally, some experts are predicting that Australia may struggle without Tim Cahill – who was recently ruled out due to injury. Cahill had been a scoring powerhouse for the Socceroos in past fixtures, so his absence could spell trouble for the team.</p>
<p>Others are betting that Slovenia’s midfielder Kevin Kampl will be a key player in Saturday’s match up. Kampl’s skills and experience could be what tips the scales in Slovenia’s favour.</p>
<p>So far, no one is quite sure how this matchup is going to play out. Both teams have proven themselves to be capable of winning, so it’s anyone’s game at this point. However, with Australia having to face off against Brazil just a few days later, it looks like they may have their work cut out for them if they want to make it through to the next round of the tournament.</p>
<h1 id="Socceroos’-Group-Opening-Match-Loss-To-Slovenia-A-Blow-To-Sports-Bettors"><a href="#Socceroos’-Group-Opening-Match-Loss-To-Slovenia-A-Blow-To-Sports-Bettors" class="headerlink" title="Socceroos’ Group Opening Match Loss To Slovenia A Blow To Sports Bettors"></a>Socceroos’ Group Opening Match Loss To Slovenia A Blow To Sports Bettors</h1><p> Socceroos’ Group Opening Match Loss To Slovenia A Blow To Sports Bettors</p>
<p>Australia fought hard but went down 1-0 to Slovenia in their opening World Cup Group C match yesterday, a result that is likely to have disappointed sports bettors.</p>
<p>Despite the loss, there were some positives for Australia, with Tomi Juric looking dangerous up front and Aaron Mooy playing well in midfield. However, the Socceroos will need to improve if they are to progress beyond the group stage.</p>
<p>With France, Peru and Denmark lying in wait, Australia will have to get their campaign back on track when they take on group favourites France in their next match. Les Bleus are expected to win the group and anything other than a win for the Socceroos would be seen as a major upset.</p>
<p>France are one of the favourites to win the World Cup and they come into the tournament with plenty of momentum, having won all 10 of their qualifying games. They are also undefeated in their past 18 matches, making them a difficult opponent for any team.</p>
<p>Australia’s chances of progressing past the group stage hinge on whether they can beat France and secure one or two points from their other two Group C matches. Denmark look like they could be another tricky opponent, while Peru may not be as tough as France but should not be underestimated either.</p>
<p>It is going to be a difficult task for Australia but with home support behind them and some improved performances, they could cause an upset or two and make it through to the knockout stages.</p>
<h1 id="Slovenia-Beats-Socceroos-In-Sports-Betting"><a href="#Slovenia-Beats-Socceroos-In-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Slovenia Beats Socceroos In Sports Betting"></a>Slovenia Beats Socceroos In Sports Betting</h1><p>Australia’s Socceroos started their World Cup campaign brightly with a 2-1 victory over reigning champions, France. However, they couldn’t maintain the momentum as they lost their next two group games against Denmark and Peru. This resulted in them being eliminated from the competition, much to the disappointment of the country’s fans.</p>
<p>Slovenia, on the other hand, had a rather mixed World Cup campaign. They started off with a 3-2 victory over Algeria, but then lost their next match against England. They managed to win their final game in the group stages against Panama, but it wasn’t enough to progress to the next round.</p>
<p>Despite Slovenia’s underwhelming performance at the World Cup, they were still able to beat Australia in sports betting. This is due to the fact that Australia was considered as one of the strongest teams at the event, while Slovenia was seen as an underdog. As a result of this mismatch, Australians would have only received favourable odds if they had bet on their team winning.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there were some Aussies who managed to make money by betting on Slovenia. One punter placed a $10 bet on Slovenia winning at odds of 71&#x2F;20 and won $71 dollars in return. While this may not seem like a lot of money, it goes to show that every little bit counts when it comes to sports betting.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how both Australia and Slovenia perform in future international tournaments. However, for now at least, Slovenia can claim bragging rights over Australia after beating them in sports betting.</p>
<h1 id="Slovenia-Tops-Socceroos-In-World-Cup-Betting"><a href="#Slovenia-Tops-Socceroos-In-World-Cup-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Slovenia Tops Socceroos In World Cup Betting"></a>Slovenia Tops Socceroos In World Cup Betting</h1><p>Ahead of Tuesday’s World Cup encounter, Slovenia has been installed as a $2.75 betting favourite over Australia with bookmakers Neds.</p>
<p>The Socceroos have been given odds of $3 to win the match, while a draw is paying out at $3.50.</p>
<p>Ned’s unlikely but not impossible tip would be for Slovenia to win 2-1 at odds of $11.</p>
<h1 id="How-Sports-Betting-Has-Helped-Spread-The-Word-About-Slovenia"><a href="#How-Sports-Betting-Has-Helped-Spread-The-Word-About-Slovenia" class="headerlink" title="How Sports Betting Has Helped Spread The Word About Slovenia"></a>How Sports Betting Has Helped Spread The Word About Slovenia</h1><p>The small Balkan country of Slovenia may not be the first place that comes to mind when thinking about sports, but it is in fact a hotbed of sporting activity. In addition to hosting top-level competitions in a range of sports, Slovenia’s love of betting on sport has helped to spread the word about this little-known nation to a global audience.</p>
<p>Slovenians have been betting on sport for centuries, with horse racing being particularly popular. In more recent years, football has become the most popular sport to bet on, and the industry has grown rapidly as a result. There are now hundreds of licensed sports betting providers in Slovenia, with most of them focusing on football betting.</p>
<p>The rise in popularity of sports betting in Slovenia has been matched by a corresponding growth in interest in the country’s sporting teams and athletes. This was most evident at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, where Slovenian athletes picked up six medals, including two golds. Bets placed on Slovenian competitors helped to drive up interest in the games and make them a financial success for the Slovenian bookmakers.</p>
<p> Sports betting has also helped to promote tourism in Slovenia. Bookmakers often offer promotional odds for major events such as the World Cup or the Champions League final, and this can attract punters from all over the world looking for an edge on their bets. As well as providing an economic boost for Slovenia, this influx of tourists helps to raise awareness of the country and its attractions.</p>
<p>It is clear that sports betting has played a significant role in promoting Slovenia both domestically and internationally. With its rich sporting heritage and passionate fans, Slovenia is well-placed to take advantage of this growing industry and continue attracting new visitors and investment.</p>
