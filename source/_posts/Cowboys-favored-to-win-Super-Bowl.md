#  Cowboys favored to win Super Bowl

The Dallas Cowboys are favored to win the Super Bowl this year, according to most sports books. The Cowboys have looked like the best team in the league all season long, and they have one of the best offenses in the NFL.

The Cowboys have a tough road to the Super Bowl, though. They will have to beat the Green Bay Packers in the NFC Championship Game in order to advance to the Super Bowl. The Packers are a very good team, and they will be a tough matchup for the Cowboys.

If the Cowboys can win their next two games, they will be crowned champions of the NFL.

#  Cowboys continue to be one of NFL's most popular teams

For the past few decades, the Dallas Cowboys have been one of the most popular teams in the NFL. Even though they haven't won a Super Bowl in over 20 years, they still have a large and loyal following.

Some of the reasons for their popularity are their flashy style of play, their star-studded roster, and their passionate fans. The Cowboys are always one of the most watched teams on TV, and they continue to sell out every game at Jerry World.

The team's success over the years has also helped contribute to their popularity. They were one of the dominant teams in the 1990s, and they have had some memorable playoff runs in recent years.

Despite their recent playoff failures, the Cowboys are still one of the best teams in the league and should be contenders for the Super Bowl this year. If they can finally win another championship, it will only add to their popularity.

#  Cowboys favored to win NFC East

The Dallas Cowboys have been the class of the NFC East for the last few years. And, oddsmakers believe that will continue in 2018.

The Cowboys are currently favored to win the NFC East according to odds released by Bovada. The New York Giants are listed as the second choice, while the Philadelphia Eagles and Washington Redskins are both given long odds to win the division.

Dallas is coming off a 9-7 season in which they missed the playoffs. However, they should be much improved in 2018 with the return of quarterback Dak Prescott and running back Ezekiel Elliott from injury. The Cowboys also added some weapons on offense this offseason, signing wide receiver Allen Hurns and drafting wide receiver Michael Gallup in the third round.

On defense, Dallas lost linebacker Anthony Hitchens in free agency but they retained defensive end DeMarcus Lawrence and cornerback Orlando Scandrick. They also drafted linebacker Leighton Vander Esch in the first round.

The Giants finished last season with a 3-13 record, but they made some big changes this offseason. They fired head coach Ben McAdoo and general manager Jerry Reese and hired Pat Shurmur as their new head coach and Dave Gettleman as their new general manager.

Shurmur has a history of turning around struggling teams, so there is hope that he can do the same with the Giants. They have some talent on offense, led by quarterback Eli Manning and wide receivers Odell Beckham Jr. and Sterling Shepard. However, their defense is still a question mark.

The Eagles are coming off back-to-back Super Bowl appearances, but they are facing some major challenges this season. Quarterback Carson Wentz is recovering from a torn ACL and it’s not clear if he will be ready for Week 1. If he isn’t able to play, Nick Foles will have to step in and try to lead them to another championship.

The Eagles also lost several key players in free agency, including tight end Trey Burton, cornerback Patrick Robinson and running back LeGarrette Blount. They replaced those players with veteran receivers Mike Wallace and Alshon Jeffery, cornerback Ronald Darby and running back Jay Ajayi.

Washington finished last season 7-9, but they have made some improvements this offseason. They hired former Houston Texans head coach Bill O’Brien as their new offensive coordinator and signed quarterback Alex Smith to a four-year contract worth $94 million. Smith replaces Kirk Cousins who signed with the Minnesota Vikings earlier this offseason.
