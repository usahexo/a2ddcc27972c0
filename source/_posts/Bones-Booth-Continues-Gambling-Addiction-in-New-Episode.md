#  Bones Booth's Gambling Addiction Returns in New Episode

In the new episode of Bones, Booth's gambling addiction makes a return. This time, it threatens to ruin his relationship with Brennan.

Booth first started gambling when he was in the army. He would bet on football games, and he always won. But his addiction escalated after he joined the FBI. He started betting on other things, such as poker and blackjack, and he began to lose more often than he won.

Eventually, Booth's gambling caused him to lose his job, and he almost lost Brennan as well. But she stood by him, and they eventually got married.

Now, Booth's gambling addiction is back. In the new episode, we see him losing a lot of money at a casino. And later, we see him trying to borrow money from Brennan so that he can keep gambling.

Fortunately, Booth does get help for his addiction in the end. After a heart-to-heart talk with Brennan, he goes to rehab and gets clean.
