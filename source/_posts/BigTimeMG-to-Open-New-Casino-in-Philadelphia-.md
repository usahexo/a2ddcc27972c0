#  BigTimeMG to Open New Casino in Philadelphia 

Pennsylvania’s second largest casino is set to open their doors in just a few short months. The $425 million BigTimeMG casino is slated to open on July 3rd in Philadelphia and is already anticipated to be one of the most popular gambling destinations in the state.

The new casino features over 125,000 square feet of gaming space, including 2,500 slot machines and 125 table games. There will also be a 12-story luxury hotel with 300 rooms, eight restaurants, and a spa and fitness center.

The opening of this new casino is welcome news for the state of Pennsylvania, which has seen its gambling revenue decline in recent years. The hope is that the new casino will help to bring some of that money back into the state.

For Philadelphia, the opening of BigTimeMG represents an exciting opportunity to bring more tourism and jobs to the area. The new casino is expected to create 1,000 jobs in total, with many of those positions being filled by local residents.

In addition to providing jobs and economic growth, the new casino is also anticipated to generate millions of dollars in tax revenue for the city and state. This money will go towards funding important projects such as education and infrastructure improvements.

So far, things are looking good for BigTimeMG as they prepare for their grand opening. With so much at stake, we can expect them to pull out all the stops in order to make sure that it is a success.
