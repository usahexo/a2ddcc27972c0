#  The Top Five Poker Hands That Beat PokerStars

There are a lot of different poker hands that can be played in Texas Hold'em, but not all of them are created equal. In this article, we're going to take a look at the five best hands that can be played at PokerStars and why they're so strong.

1. Royal Flush

The royal flush is the best hand in poker and is made up of the five highest ranked cards in the deck - A, K, Q, J, 10. This hand is unbeatable and will always win the pot when it's played.



2. Straight Flush

The straight flush is a hand that consists of five consecutive cards all of the same suit. This is a very powerful hand and is generally only beaten by a royal flush. If you're lucky enough to get one of these hands, you should always try and make sure you get as much money into the pot as possible.


3. Four-of-a-Kind

The four-of-a-kind is a hand that consists of four cards of the same rank and one card of another rank. This hand is very powerful and can beat almost any other hand in poker - except for a straight flush or royal flush. If you're lucky enough to get dealt a four-of-a-kind, make sure you bet big and try to win the whole pot!


4. Full House

A full house is made up of three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank. This hand is very strong and can beat most other hands in poker with the exception of a four-of-a-kind or better. If you're lucky enough to get dealt a full house, make sure you play conservatively and wait for the right time to bet big.



5. Flush

A flush is made up of five cards all of the same suit, excluding 4 suits (no clubs). This hand isn't as strong as some of the other hands on this list, but it's still powerful enough to take down most other hands in poker. If you're dealt a flush, make sure you bet aggressively and try to win as much money as possible from your opponents

#  How to Beat PokerStars: The Five Best Hands

It’s no secret that PokerStars is the world’s largest online poker site. The company has been around since 2001 and is currently the market leader in the industry. In this article, we will take a look at five of the best hands to play against PokerStars, based on our experience playing against the site.

1. The Aces

The aces are always a strong starting hand, and they are especially potent against PokerStars. If you can get all-in with your aces preflop, you have a very good chance of winning the pot. However, you should be aware that some players might try to reraise you with a smaller pair or suited connector, so be prepared to fold if it’s not in your best interest to continue.

2. The Kings

The kings are another strong hand that can be very profitable against PokerStars. Like the aces, you want to try to get all-in preflop if possible, but you should also be prepared for a reraise with a hand like ace-queen or king-queen. If you do get reraised, it’s usually best to fold unless you have a very strong kicker.

3. The Queens

Queens are another very strong hand that can hold its own against any opponent at PokerStars. You want to aim for an all-in preflop showdown whenever possible, but be aware that some players might try to reraise with something like ace-king or two pair. Just like with the kings, if you do get reraised it’s usually best to fold unless you have a very strong kicker.

4. The Jacks

Jacks are still considered a strong hand at PokerStars, although they are not quite as powerful as the previous three hands we have discussed. Still, jacks provide a good starting point and can often win small pots without much trouble. You should generally aim to get all-in preflop if possible, but be prepared for opponents who might have a stronger hand than yours.

5. The Tens or Better

Tens or better is not generally considered to be a strong hand at Texas Hold’em, but it can still be profitable against PokerStars. This hand is especially useful when playing against weaker opponents who are more likely to call than raise preflop. By playing tight and only putting in bets when you have a good chance of winning the pot, you can often make money off of loose players at PokerStars with this hand
