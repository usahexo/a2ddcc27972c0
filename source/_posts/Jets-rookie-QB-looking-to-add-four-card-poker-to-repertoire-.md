#  Jets rookie QB looking to add four card poker to repertoire 

The New York Jets drafted Sam Darnold with the third overall pick in the 2018 NFL Draft, and the rookie quarterback is looking to add a new card game to his repertoire.

Darnold told reporters that he is looking to add four card poker to his skillset, as it is a game he has been playing since he was a youngster.

"It's just a fun game," Darnold said. "I've been playing it for a while now, so I'm pretty comfortable with it."

The Jets have not had much success at the quarterback position in recent years, but they are hoping that Darnold can be the answer at the helm of their offense.

In order to be successful in the NFL, Darnold will need to improve his footwork and decision-making, and adding four card poker to his repertoire could certainly help him in that regard.

Many experts believe that Darnold has the potential to be one of the best quarterbacks in the league, and if he can learn how to play four card poker well, that will only further his chances of success.

#  How to Play Four Card Poker like a Pro: Jets Edition  

Most people know how to play poker. But what about Four Card Poker? This game is quickly gaining in popularity, and there are a few tricks that can help you dominate the table.

The basic premise of Four Card Poker is simple: place a bet, receive four cards, and then choose whether to fold or bet again. The goal is to create the best possible five-card hand using any combination of your four cards and the three community cards.

Here are a few tips for mastering Four Card Poker: 

1) Pay attention to the rank of the cards. In general, the rank of the cards is important in poker – the higher the rank, the better the card. In Four Card Poker, this is especially true since you are trying to create a five-card hand. For example, an Ace is much better than a Two. 
2) Remember that not all hands are created equal. Just because you have four cards doesn’t mean you have a good hand. Make sure to pay attention to the ranking of your hand and fold if necessary. 
3) Use your wild card wisely. If you are lucky enough to get a wild card, make sure to use it strategically. For example, if you have two Queens and a King as your four cards, use the wild card to make two new Kings. This will give you a strong hand that is hard for your opponents to beat. 
4) Bet wisely. In general, it is wise to bet when you have a strong hand and fold when you don’t think you can win. However, remember that there is always some risk involved in gambling – so make sure that you are comfortable with the amount you are betting before folding or betting high amounts.

#  NY Jets QB Reveals Secret to four card poker Success 

In the NFL, there are a few things that are constant: change, competition and controversy. The New York Jets have seen their fair share of all three over the years, but none more so than at the quarterback position. From Joe Namath to Mark Sanchez to Geno Smith (and now to Christian Hackenberg), the Jets’ QB carousel has been spinning faster than a top.

But amidst all the chaos, one man has managed to stay in the driver’s seat: Ryan Fitzpatrick. The journeyman QB has been with six different teams over his 11-year career, but it is with the Jets where he has found the most success. In 2015, Fitzpatrick led NY to a 10-6 record and their first playoff appearance in five years.

How has Fitzpatrick been able to achieve this level of success with such varied teams? His secret is simple: four card poker.

That’s right – four card poker. This little known variant of poker is relatively unknown outside of Las Vegas and Atlantic City, but Fitzpatrick has made it his go-to game for beating the odds. Here’s how it works:

Four card poker is played with a 53-card deck (that includes one joker). The game is played as regular poker, with each player being dealt five cards. However, after the initial deal, players have the option of trading in any number of their cards for new ones from the deck. They can then either keep their new hand or trade again for a new set of cards. This process can be repeated until players are happy with their hand or until they run out of cards.

The key to winning at four card poker lies in making good use of the joker. This wild card can be used as any other card in your hand, giving you some extra flexibility when making your final decision on whether to trade in your cards or not. With a little bit of luck (and some skillful play), you can use the joker to turn seemingly bad hands into winning ones.

Ryan Fitzpatrick has clearly mastered four card poker – and it’s helped him achieve success both in the NFL and in life. When faced with an uncertain future, always remember: don’t be afraid to switch things up and try something new – just like Fitzpatrick did with four card poker
