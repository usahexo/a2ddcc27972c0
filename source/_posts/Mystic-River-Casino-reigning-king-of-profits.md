The Mystic River Casino enjoyed a banner year in 2017, raking in $81 million in profits. This is the second consecutive year that the casino has enjoyed record profits, and officials are attributing the success to a number of factors, including the introduction of new games and attractions.

"Our customers have spoken, and they clearly love the new games and experiences we've been offering," said casino spokesperson Laurie Janes. "We're looking forward to seeing continued growth in 2018."

To celebrate their success, the casino is giving back to the community with a special donation. They are pledging to donate $1 million to local charities and organizations.

"Mystic River Casino is committed to giving back to the communities that have supported us," Janes said. "We're proud to be able to donate more than $1 million to local charities and organizations this year."

#  Mystic River Casino fourth-straight profitable year

The Mystic River Casino had another profitable year in 2017, marking their fourth consecutive year of profitability.

The casino generated $26.5 million in net income last year, a slight decrease from their $27.5 million income in 2016. However, the casino’s president and CEO, Michael Mathis, is still happy with the results.

“2017 was another successful year for Mystic River Casino as we generated over $26 million in net income,” said Mathis in a statement. “This demonstrates our ability to generate consistent profits while continuing to reinvest in our business and provide our guests with the best gaming and entertainment experience possible.”

The Mystic River Casino has seen steady growth since it opened its doors in 2013. In its first year of operation, the casino generated just over $18 million in net income. The casino has now increased its profits each year for the past four years.

Much of the casino’s success can be attributed to its focus on providing a high-quality gaming experience. The casino offers more than 2,000 slot machines and nearly 80 table games, as well as a variety of restaurants and entertainment options.

The Mystic River Casino is also one of the only casinos in Massachusetts to offer live harness racing. The casino’s live harness racing track drew nearly 142,000 fans last year, up from 131,000 fans in 2016.

Mathis says that the casino plans to continue reinvesting in its business in order to maintain its position as one of the top-performing casinos in New England. This includes upgrades to the casino’s restaurant area, as well as new gaming options like eSports and virtual reality gaming.
