#  What is NBA? 

In the National Basketball Association (NBA), basketball is the main sport. It was founded in 1946. The NBA is a professional league for menâ€™s basketball in North America. There are 30 teams in the NBA, 29 from the USA and 1 from Canada. The regular season lasts from October to April and the playoffs from April to June. 

Basketball is a physical sport that combines athleticism, strategy and teamwork. Two teams of five players try to score points by throwing a round ball through a circular hoop or basket mounted at each end of a rectangular court. The team with more points at the end of the game wins. 

Players can move around the court by dribbling or running with the ball. They can also pass it to their teammates. Players must stop dribbling when they have both feet on the ground. If they trip or are knocked down, they must release the ball and cannot pick it up again until they have touched both feet on the ground. 

There are five players on each team: three frontcourt players and two backcourt players. The frontcourt players are usually bigger and slower than the backcourt players. The point guard is usually the smallest player on the court and is responsible for bringing the ball up court and initiating plays offensively. The center is responsible for rebounding (getting control of) missed shots and blocking shots on defense. 

The game is played in four quarters of 10 minutes each, with a 12-minute break between quarters two and three, and a 20-minute break at halftime. A time-out can be called by either team during play or at any time while the ball is dead (not moving). There are also mandatory time-outs called by officials after fouls or violations. 

The NBA has many rules that differ from those in high school or college basketball. For example, professional players cannot run with the ball; they must stop dribbling once they have both feet on the ground. In addition, defenders cannot hold onto an offensive player longer than three seconds without actively trying to block his progress or take away his space. Also, goaltending (touching a shot as it goes up toward the basket) is illegal in pro basketball, whereas it is allowed in other levels of competition. 

The most exciting part of NBA games is when one team makes a comeback in the final few minutes to win!

#  Do you think they are all related? 

The events of the past week have led to a lot of speculation on social media about whether or not they are related. On September 14, three explosive devices were found in mailboxes in New York City. One exploded when police tried to disarm it, injuring four officers. The next day, an additional bomb was found in a mailbox in Delaware. Then, on Saturday, a device was found in a bag at a train station in New Jersey.

So far there have been no injuries or deaths associated with these bombings, but the fact that there have been so many in such a short period of time has left many people worried. And, of course, many are wondering if this is all part of some larger plot.

There has been no official word from law enforcement about whether or not they believe the events are related, but that has not stopped people from speculating. Some are pointing to the fact that all of the bombs were sent through the mail as evidence that they are connected. Others are noting that all of the devices have used timers, which suggests that they may have been meant to go off at different times.

At this point it is too early to say for sure whether or not these bombings are related. However, law enforcement is certainly taking them seriously and is doing everything it can to investigate them. In the meantime, we will just have to wait and see what comes out...

#  How so?

On the surface, Bitcoin may not seem to have a lot of uses. After all, it can only be used as a digital currency, and there are many other digital currencies available. However, when you look at Bitcoin more closely, you'll see that it has a lot of potential uses.

For example, Bitcoin can be used to purchase goods and services online. It can also be used to pay for things in brick-and-mortar stores. In addition, Bitcoin can be used to invest in other digital currencies. Lastly, it can be used to transfer money internationally without having to pay any fees.
