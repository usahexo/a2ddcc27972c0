#  LeBron James and Kyrie Irving Lead Cavs to Victory Over 76ers in Blackjack

The Cleveland Cavaliers started the 2017-2018 season with a bang, defeating the Philadelphia 76ers in blackjack. Led by LeBron James and Kyrie Irving, the Cavs were able to hold on to their lead, despite some late game

Kyrie Irving was especially impressive, scoring 26 points and making some key shots down the stretch.

"It was great to see Kyrie dominate like that," said Cavs head coach Tyronn Lue. "He's really been working on his game this offseason and it showed tonight."

LeBron James was also impressive, scoring 24 points and grabbing 10 rebounds. "We knew we had to come out strong tonight," said James. "This is a new season and we want to start off on the right foot."

The Cavs will next face the Boston Celtics on Wednesday night.

#  Golden State Warriors Can't Stop Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook in Blackjack

The Golden State Warriors lost to the Oklahoma City Thunder 122-96 on Wednesday, and the two main reasons were Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook. The dynamic duo was unstoppable in blackjack, as they both had over 25 points each.

Westbrook was especially impressive, as he hit 10 of his 17 shots from the field. Durant was close behind him with 9 of 16 shooting. Combined, the two players shot 58 percent from the field.

In order for the Warriors to be successful, they need to find a way to stop Durant and Westbrook. Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson both had solid games offensively, but they were unable to slow down the Thunder's attack.

The Thunder now have a 2-1 advantage in the series, and they will look to build on that in Game 4 on Sunday.

#  Carmelo Anthony Struggles as New York Knicks Lose to Atlanta Hawks in Blackjack

In the game of blackjack, if the player has a total sum of cards that is higher than the dealer's total but lower than 21, that player is said to have a "good hand." On Monday night, Carmelo Anthony and the New York Knicks found out what it feels like to have a good hand against the Atlanta Hawks--and still lose.

The Knicks were led by Anthony, who scored 37 points and added 10 rebounds. However, Atlanta's balanced scoring attack was too much for New York to handle, as five players scored in double figures for the Hawks. In the end, Atlanta prevailed 116-104.

It was a rough night for Anthony and the Knicks overall. Aside from Anthony's big performance, no other New York player scored more than 16 points. The Hawks also managed to out-rebounded the Knicks 52-33, which was a key factor in their victory.

This loss drops the Knicks to 9-19 on the season and they are now 5th in the Eastern Conference standings. They will look to get back on track when they host the Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday night.

#  Houston Rockets Win Big with James Harden Leading the Way in Blackjack

The Houston Rockets were looking to bounce back from a disappointing Game 1 loss to the Golden State Warriors in the Western Conference Finals. And what better way to do that than by winning big at the blackjack table?

Led by MVP James Harden, the Rockets managed to win big, banking over $27,000 in just a few hours. And they did it all while wearing their blackjack uniforms, which seemed to give them an extra edge.

"We were feeling good after our win and decided to keep the momentum going by hitting the blackjack tables," said Harden. "We had a lot of fun and I'm just glad we could come away with a big victory."

The Rockets will look to carry that momentum into Game 2 on Wednesday night as they look to even up the series.

#  Toronto Raptors Come Out on Top Against Boston Celtics in Blackjack

The Toronto Raptors came out on top in a blackjack matchup against the Boston Celtics on Monday night. The final score was 104-99 in favor of Toronto.

Boston played well early on, leading by as many as eight points in the first quarter. But Toronto mounted a comeback in the second, taking a five-point lead into halftime. The Raptors never looked back, pulling away in the fourth to secure the victory.

DeMar DeRozan led the way for Toronto with 33 points on 12-of-23 shooting. Kyle Lowry added 18 points, eight assists and seven rebounds, while Serge Ibaka chipped in 16 points and 10 rebounds. Kyrie Irving led Boston with 26 points, while Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum each added 17.

It was a crucial win for the Raptors, who now sit in third place in the Eastern Conference standings with a record of 41-16. Boston, meanwhile, falls to fifth place with a record of 38-21.
