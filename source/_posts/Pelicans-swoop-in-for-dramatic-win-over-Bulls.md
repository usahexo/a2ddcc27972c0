#  Pelicans swoop in for dramatic win over Bulls

The New Orleans Pelicans staged a dramatic comeback to defeat the Chicago Bulls 101-99 on Wednesday night. The Pelicans (24-21) were trailing by 14 points with just over five minutes remaining, but they rallied to score the game's final 16 points.

Anthony Davis led the way for New Orleans with 34 points and 20 rebounds. Jrue Holiday added 21 points, and Rajon Rondo had 15 assists.

Chicago (18-29) was led by Bobby Portis with 25 points and 10 rebounds. Kris Dunn added 18 points, and Denzel Valentine had 16 points and 11 rebounds.

The Bulls appeared to be in control of the game early on, taking a 55-41 lead into halftime. But the Pelicans came out strong in the second half, outscoring Chicago 60-44 in the final two quarters.

It was Davis' fourth straight game with at least 30 points and 20 rebounds, breaking Wilt Chamberlain's NBA record.

"I don't really care about no damn records," Davis said after the game. "All I care about is winning."

The victory improved the Pelicans' record to 5-2 since DeMarcus Cousins was traded to the Sacramento Kings earlier this month. It was also their second win over the Bulls this season; they defeated Chicago 119-110 on December 4th.

With 22 games remaining, New Orleans is in ninth place in the Western Conference playoff race. They remain four games behind the Los Angeles Clippers for the eighth and final playoff spot.

#  Davis leads Pelicans to victory over Nuggets

With Anthony Davis leading the way, the New Orleans Pelicans beat the Denver Nuggets 116-99 on Saturday night.

Davis had 26 points and 11 rebounds for his fourth consecutive double-double. Jrue Holiday scored 21 points, Nikola Mirotic had 20 and Darius Miller came off the bench to score a season-high 18 for the Pelicans.

Davis was 10 of 15 from the field and 6 of 7 from the free throw line.

"He's been really consistent," Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. "He's playing at a high level."

Jamal Murray led Denver with 22 points, and Gary Harris and Nikola Jokic each had 21.

#  Holiday lifts shorthanded Pelicans past Sixers

The New Orleans Pelicans were missing three starters but got a big lift from Solomon Hill in their 119-108 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers on Saturday night.

Hill, who missed the previous two games with an ankle injury, came off the bench to score a season-high 27 points, including six in the final minute.

"That's what I'm supposed to do - come in and provide some juice," Hill said. "I was happy to have an opportunity to do that."

The Pelicans (23-21) were without injured starters DeMarcus Cousins (Achilles), Anthony Davis (groin) and Jrue Holiday (leg). They also lost point guard Rajon Rondo early to a facial laceration.

"We knew we had to step up," Hill said. "We've got a lot of guys who can play ball and we just had to lock in."

Julius Randle, starting at center in place of Cousins, had 21 points and 18 rebounds. E'Twaun Moore added 20 points for New Orleans, which shot 50 percent (46 of 92) from the field and made 16 of 34 3-pointers.

"We played together as a team," Moore said. "Everybody stepped up."

JJ Redick led Philadelphia with 30 points, T.J. McConnell had 17 points and 10 assists, and Ben Simmons added 16 points. The 76ers (19-25) lost for the sixth time in eight games.
